# Grader-Connect
_This is still a work-in-progress project and not ready for deployment_

In the course I grade for, ITCS 3155 at UNC Charlotte, me and other graders ran into the issue where we would separately message the professor when we finished grading, rather than all waiting and sending one message when the grades are ready to be sent out; Grader Connect is the solution! Grader Connect is a streamlined application designed to simplify the coordination of grading tasks between graders and professors. Built using Vue.js for the frontend, Go for the backend, and MySQL for the database, this app facilitates efficient communication and grading status tracking, enhancing the grading process for educational institutions.
